            <h1>About Aesthetic Backgrounds: A Practical, Calm Curation Guide</h1>

            <section id="mission">
                <h2>Our mission: make aesthetic background design easier</h2>
                <p>Aesthetic Backgrounds exists to simplify the overwhelming world of wallpaper selection through educational guidance rather than endless galleries. Our international audience spans creative professionals, productivity enthusiasts, and anyone seeking to create more intentional digital environments across their devices.</p>
                
                <p>Rather than competing with massive wallpaper repositories, we focus on teaching the principles that help you evaluate and choose aesthetic backgrounds effectively. This approach serves users better in the long term—instead of bookmarking hundreds of images you'll never use, you develop the skills to quickly identify backgrounds that truly serve your needs and aesthetic goals.</p>
                
                <p>Our guidance framework addresses real-world challenges: How do you ensure a background works across different lighting conditions? What makes some aesthetic phone wallpapers more practical than others? How do you build a cohesive collection without falling into decision paralysis? These questions drive our content development and curation philosophy.</p>
                
                <p>We believe that understanding aesthetic background design principles empowers better choices across all visual decisions, from workspace organization to personal branding. Visit our main <a href="/">collection guide</a> to see these principles in action, or explore our <a href="/faq">common questions about wallpapers</a> for specific implementation guidance.</p>

            <section id="method">
                <h2>How we think about a beautiful aesthetic wallpaper</h2>
                <p>Our editorial framework evaluates aesthetic backgrounds across five key dimensions: composition strength, palette cohesion, negative space utilization, texture appropriateness, and practical usability. This systematic approach helps distinguish between images that merely look appealing in thumbnails and those that function well as actual backgrounds.</p>
                
                <p>Composition strength examines how visual elements are arranged and balanced within the frame. Strong compositions guide the eye naturally and create stable focal points that don't compete with interface elements. We look for backgrounds that demonstrate intentional design choices rather than accidental arrangements, even in naturally occurring scenes.</p>
                
                <p>Palette cohesion considers how colors work together and with typical interface elements. The most successful aesthetic backgrounds use color relationships that enhance rather than fight with the overlaid content. This includes understanding how different display technologies render colors and how ambient lighting affects perception throughout the day.</p>
                
                <p>Negative space utilization becomes crucial for practical functionality. Beautiful aesthetic wallpapers must provide appropriate areas for icons, widgets, and text without sacrificing their visual integrity. We evaluate how backgrounds handle the transition zones between busy and calm areas, ensuring smooth integration with user interface elements.</p>
                
                <p>Texture appropriateness examines whether surface qualities enhance or detract from the overall aesthetic. Subtle textures can add richness and depth, while excessive texture can create visual noise that becomes fatiguing over time. We consider how textures scale across different screen sizes and resolutions to maintain their intended effect.</p>

                <h2>Sourcing and attribution guidance</h2>
                <p>We advocate for responsible sourcing practices that respect creator rights while providing practical guidance for users seeking free aesthetic backgrounds. Understanding licensing frameworks protects both users and creators, fostering a sustainable ecosystem for high-quality visual content.</p>
                
                <p><a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/" rel="external">Creative Commons licensing</a> provides standardized frameworks that balance creator recognition with user accessibility. We encourage users to understand these different license types and their implications for various use cases, from personal desktop wallpapers to commercial design projects.</p>
                
                <p>Public domain resources offer the greatest usage flexibility, though quality and relevance can vary significantly. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain" rel="external">Public domain works</a> include government publications, expired copyrights, and content explicitly released by creators. These sources often provide excellent options for users who need clear usage rights for professional or commercial applications.</p>
                
                <p>Attribution practices vary widely across different platforms and licensing types. We recommend maintaining simple documentation of your sources and their requirements, even when attribution isn't legally required. This practice supports creators and helps you track the provenance of your aesthetic background collection over time.</p>
